~ Even better workaround for very badly written system plugins which output Javascript without a trailing semicolon and/or newline, leading to Javascript errors. This is not a bug in our software, it's a bug in those badly written plugins and WE have to work around THEIR bad code!
~ Work around for the  overreaching password managers in so-called modern browsers which fill random, irrelevant passwords in the JPS and ANGIE password fields, without asking you and without notifying you, without letting developers tell them "no, do not autocomplete this field because you're doing it wrong and screwing with my clients, Mr. Stupid Browser".
