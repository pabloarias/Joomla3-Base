DO NOT REMOVE THIS FILE

This file makes sure that your backup output directory is not directly accessible from the web if you are using the
Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) web server, version 7 or later. This prevents unauthorized access to your
backup archive files and backup log files. Removing this file could have security implications for your site.

As noted above, this only works on IIS 7 or later.
See https://www.iis.net/configreference/system.webserver/security/requestfiltering/fileextensions
